The-Tech-Academy-Basic-C-Sharp-Projects
Welcome to my repository of beginner-level C# projects completed as part of The Tech Academy's software development course. This repository contains small assignments, exercises, and practice projects designed to build a solid foundation in C# programming.

Contents Console applications Variables and data types Conditional logic Loops and arrays Methods and classes Error handling File I/O Object-oriented programming basics I will continue to update this repository as I progress through the course. Each project will be placed in its own folder and include code files and documentation.

Purpose This repository also serves as part of my online coding portfolio to showcase my progress and experience with C#. Thank you for visiting!
